Peaks README

## Project Idea

What is your project idea?  How did you come up with it? Why? Who would use it?

```md
Push Peaks, a application that tracks the peaks you've gotten to. Just kind of came up in my head I guess, and then kind of used peak series running modo push peaks and made it pushed peaks.  People who push peaks, in Colorado loads of people are wierdly competetive about climbing 14ers and kind of up tight about it, but I think it would be great for logging any summit you get to and keep track of how many, elvetion or time hiked, etc.
```

## Write between 3-5 user stories

We have gone over this before. Please refer to your notes, previous repos or the
google machine if you need further assistance.

```md
As a user I want to be able to log the peak name
As a user I want to be able to log the distance hiked/climbed/ran (can clump as 1 distance traveled in miles)
As a user I want to be able to sign up
As a user I want to be able to sign in and view my peaks stats
As a user I want to be able to view other peoples stats
```

## Wireframes

Please create a wireframe of your planned front end.

## Plan your resources

What resources will you need? What will the attributes and relationships be?

```md
I'll probably refer to my tic tac toe game for attributes on all Authentication to keep things simple.  For the peak statistics I'll probably group the peak name and stats in a class then use and id for each seperate one so I can manipulate them later.  As well as give all message responses seperate ids where there message prints so I can simply hide and show them when necessary.
```

## Create an ERD (entity relationship diagram)

These are the diagrams that show how your resources are related to one another
(one to many, many to many, etc).

Include an image (or a link to image) below.

```md
pretty simple but I couldn't think of any reason to add more.

## Routing

What routes will you need to make the proper request to your API?

```md
Peaks for the number of Peaks
peak for retriving a specific peak
another peak for creating a new peak
your peaks would be cool to print all your peaks in box with stats(on wire frame) but not sure if its realalstic.
```

## Timetable

Write a basic timetable for yourself, you don't have to stick to it but it
helps to go in with a plan.

```md
I don't know when the project starts or ends and am unable to find any info on that.
```
