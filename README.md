# Peaks api: A Description

Push Peaks, an application that tracks the peaks you've gotten to. It's kind of a run on the peak series running modo push peaks.  It's for people who push peaks, in Colorado and Wyoming loads of people are  competetive about climbing, running, and hiking peaks, but I think it would be great for logging any summit you get to and keep track of how many, elevation or time hiked, etc. This idea kind of also came from when I was younger I climbed the Grand Teton and some of the guides there race up what would take normal people 8 hours to hike in 2 hours with two 5 gallon gas tanks for the camp.  I think this application would be great for that because you can log the peak and throw the time and a description of what you faced in the run/hike.

## Planning Story

I originally planned to make the application to only be able to view the owners peaks but later decided to make it able to views everyones peaks and descriptions because I think that's alot funner because I would be stoked to see how Jeff climbed xyz peak and what thought about it.  To plan I used the old but reliable post it notes to plan each action and how I wanted to work and then just completed each action one by one.

### User Stories

As a user I want to be able to log the peak name
As a user I want to be able to log the distance hiked/climbed/ran (can clump as 1 distance traveled in miles)
As a user I want to be able to sign up
As a user I want to be able to sign in and view my peaks stats
As a user I want to be able to view other peoples stats

### Technologies Used

- jQuery
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap
- Javascript
- handlebars.js
- Mongoose
- mongoDB

### Unsolved Problems

- Still I would like to make usernames so you can view who logged peaks and there description
- Eventually I would like to make it so you can add images to your peaks.
